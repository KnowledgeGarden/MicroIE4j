Micro Inference Engine in Java
An almost trivial exercise, created mostly for fun and to learn how to use GitHub.

The engine performs inference on Java collections which behave as 
AND lists
or
OR lists
where each list contains elements which implement the Inferable interface.
A component called Not is an Inferable that contains any Inferable.

With combinations of And, Or, and Not, it is possible to create complex
logic equations.

An Inferable can run any function desired, including requesting data,
manipulating data, making comparisons, and so forth.

A simple example is included.

Enjoy!
